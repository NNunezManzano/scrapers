# Ycombinator Web Scraping.

This folder shows the work done on the ycombinator website where public data of startup CEOs was obtained.
This was done through two methods. First, we used the API provided by the site to extract the list of companies and second, we parsed the site of each company to extract the CEO data.

Stack:
- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests (GET,POST)
- Json
- CSV

The task was performed respecting the site's rules for obtaining information, at no time sensitive data was accessed that were not published by the site itself.
